Personal portfolio website

I adapted a Bootstrap template to create my personal webpage. I changed a lot of the template content (HTML, CSS, colors, fonts, etc.) and customized the files to make the page my own.

Some original code is commented out (rather than removed) because I am undecided on whether to adapt it in the future.
